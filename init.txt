a command to init the folders and files for a mern "Inventory-tracker" project. The react front should have 3 major components, A GameComponent to allow the user to add a game/choose one from a dropdown list, A StorageSystem Component within the GameComponent that allows the user to add/choose a 'storage system' (IE bank, inventory, chest, box) and finally an ItemComponent that will store the actual item's data itself allowing for optional quantity size

Next Steps
1.	Implement the logic for each React component.
2.	Set up the backend API endpoints and connect them to MongoDB.
3.	Integrate the frontend with the backend using Axios or Fetch API.
Let me know if you'd like help with any specific part of the implementation!
